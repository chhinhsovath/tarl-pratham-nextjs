# TaRL Pratham CRUD Operations Test Report

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all forms across different user roles in the TaRL Pratham Next.js application. The analysis was conducted through systematic codebase examination and permission structure analysis.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Session Management
- **NextAuth.js** - Handles user authentication
- **Role-Based Middleware** - Enforces permissions at API level
- **School-Level Isolation** - Users restricted to assigned schools/regions

#### Permission Validation
Each API endpoint includes role validation:
```typescript
function hasPermission(userRole: string, action: string): boolean {
  const permissions = {
    admin: ["view", "create", "update", "delete"],
    coordinator: ["view", "create", "update", "delete"], // context-limited
    mentor: ["view", "create", "update"], // school-limited
    teacher: ["view", "create", "update"], // class-limited  
    viewer: ["view"] // read-only
  };
  
  return permissions[userRole as keyof typeof permissions]?.includes(action) || false;
}
```

### Data Access Controls

#### School-Level Access Control
```typescript
function canAccessStudent(userRole: string, userPilotSchoolId: number | null, studentPilotSchoolId: number | null): boolean {
  if (userRole === "admin" || userRole === "coordinator") {
    return true; // Global or regional access
  }
  
  if ((userRole === "mentor" || userRole === "teacher") && userPilotSchoolId) {
    return studentPilotSchoolId === userPilotSchoolId; // School-specific access
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

### Form Validation & Schema

All forms implement Zod validation schemas:

#### User Schema Example
```typescript
const userSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, "Name is required"),
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email format"),
  role: z.enum(["admin", "coordinator", "mentor", "teacher", "viewer"]),
  pilot_school_id: z.number().optional(),
});
```

#### Assessment Schema Example
```typescript
const assessmentSchema = z.object({
  student_id: z.number().min(1, "Student ID is required"),
  assessment_type: z.enum(["ដើមគ្រា", "ពាក់កណ្តាលគ្រា", "ចុងគ្រា"]),
  subject: z.enum(["khmer", "math"]),
  level: z.enum(["beginner", "letter", "word", "paragraph", "story"]).optional(),
});
```

## Error Handling and Validation

### API Error Responses
All endpoints return consistent error formats with Khmer language support:

```json
{
  "error": "សូមចូលប្រើប្រាស់ប្រព័ន្ធជាមុនសិន",
  "status": 401
}
```

### Common Error Scenarios:
1. **Unauthorized Access (401)**: "សូមចូលប្រើប្រាស់ប្រព័ន្ធជាមុនសិន"
2. **Forbidden Access (403)**: "អ្នកមិនមានសិទ្ធិ..." (Role-specific messages)
3. **Validation Errors (400)**: Field-specific validation messages
4. **Server Errors (500)**: Generic server error handling

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- **Zod schema validation** on all form inputs
- **SQL injection prevention** via Prisma ORM
- **XSS protection** via input sanitization
- **File upload restrictions** for photos and documents

### Access Control
- **Role-based permissions** enforced at API level
- **School-level data isolation** for mentors and teachers
- **Session-based authentication** with NextAuth.js
- **Password hashing** with bcrypt

### Data Integrity
- **Foreign key constraints** in database
- **Transaction handling** for bulk operations
- **Audit trails** via assessment history tracking
- **Soft deletes** for important records

## Recommendations

### 1. Enhanced Testing Framework
- Implement automated testing for all CRUD operations
- Add role-based integration tests
- Create test data fixtures for consistent testing

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Implement more granular error messages
- Add retry mechanisms for network failures
- Enhanced logging for debugging

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Add pagination to all list endpoints
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize bulk operations with background processing

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- Add real-time validation feedback
- Implement draft saving for long forms
- Add undo functionality for critical operations
