## 🔧 What Changed

### Before Migration
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://admin:P@ssw0rd@157.10.73.52:5432/tarl_pratham..."
```

### After Migration
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://admin:P@ssw0rd@157.10.73.82:5432/tarl_pratham..."
```

**Only the IP address changed** - all credentials remained the same for consistency.

## 🛟 Backup & Rollback

### Backups Created
1. **Old server database:** Completely untouched at 157.10.73.52
2. **Local .env backup:** `.env.backup.old-server-20251018_*`
3. **Local .env.local backup:** `.env.local.backup.old-server-20251018_*`
4. **Database backup file:** `/tmp/tarl_pratham_backup.sql` (156KB)

### Rollback Instructions (If Needed)

If you need to revert to the old server:

```bash
# 1. Restore old .env files
cp .env.backup.old-server-* .env
cp .env.local.backup.old-server-* .env.local

# 2. Regenerate Prisma client
npm run db:generate

# 3. Restart application
npm run dev
```

Your application will immediately reconnect to old server (157.10.73.52).

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Start Your Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application is now connected to the new server (157.10.73.82).

### 2. Test Functionality

Visit http://localhost:3005 (or your configured port) and test:
- ✅ Login functionality
- ✅ View users list (should show 96 users)
- ✅ View schools list (should show 45 schools)
- ✅ View students list (should show 290 students)
- ✅ Create/edit records
- ✅ Run assessments

### 3. Monitor New Server (Recommended)

```bash
# SSH into new server
ssh ubuntu@157.10.73.82
# Password: FJBPCWMd$jhkz+7A(oRgQXmv&HiE)!

# Check PostgreSQL status
sudo systemctl status postgresql

# View active connections
sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Check database size
sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('tarl_pratham'));"
```

### 4. Setup Automated Backups (Optional)

See `DATABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for complete instructions on setting up daily automated backups.
