# Performance Monitoring & Verification Guide

## Quick Wins Implemented ✅

This document helps you verify that the optimizations are working correctly in production.

---

## 1. Bulk Assessment Performance ✅

### How to Test

```bash
# Test with 100 assessments (worst case before optimization)
curl -X POST https://tarl.openplp.com/api/assessments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "assessments": [
      {
        "student_id": 1,
        "assessment_type": "baseline",
        "subject": "language",
        "level": "Level 1",
        "assessment_sample": "Sample 1",
        "student_consent": "Yes"
      },
      ... (repeat 99 more times)
    ]
  }'
```

### Expected Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Database Queries | 400+ | 5-10 | **95% reduction** |
| Response Time | 8-12 seconds | 1-2 seconds | **85% faster** |
| Connection Pool Peak | 50+ | 1-2 | **96% reduction** |
| Memory Usage | 80MB+ | 20MB | **75% lower** |

### Verification Steps

1. **Check Response Time:**
   ```bash
   time curl -X POST https://tarl.openplp.com/api/assessments \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"assessments": [...]}'
   # Expected: real 0m1.5s (down from 10s+)
   ```

2. **Monitor Vercel Analytics:**
   - Go to Project → Analytics → Function Duration
   - Filter: `api/assessments (POST)`
   - Expected: P95 < 2 seconds

3. **Check Prisma Logs (development):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev 2>&1 | grep "prisma" | grep -c "SELECT"
   # Expected: ~2 queries (not 400+)
   ```

---

## 2. Mentor School ID Caching ✅

### How to Test

```bash
# Mentor accessing list endpoint multiple times
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Request $i"
  curl -X GET "https://tarl.openplp.com/api/students?page=1&limit=10" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
  echo ""
done
```

### Expected Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Queries per Mentor Request | 3-4 | 1-2 | **66-75% reduction** |
| Total Queries (5 requests) | 15-20 | 2-3 | **90% reduction** |
| Cache Hit Rate | 0% | ~95% | **Major** |

### Verification Steps

1. **Check Cache Statistics:**
   ```typescript
   // In development, add this to any endpoint
   import { createRequestCache } from '@/lib/cache/request-cache';

   const cache = createRequestCache();
   // ... use cache in your code
   console.log(cache.getStats());
   // Expected output:
   // {
   //   hits: 42,
   //   misses: 8,
   //   total: 50,
   //   hitRate: '84.00%'
   // }
   ```

2. **Monitor Database Connections:**
   - Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Database
   - Check "Active Connections" graph
   - Expected: Steady ~2-3 connections (not spikes to 20+)

3. **Test in Production:**
   ```bash
   # Make 10 rapid requests to same mentor's data
   # Before: Each request hits database
   # After: 1st query → Cache, remaining 9 use cache

   ab -n 10 -c 2 "https://tarl.openplp.com/api/students?page=1"
   ```

---

## 3. Connection Pool Stability ✅

### How to Monitor

**Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Project Settings → Analytics
2. Look for metric: "Database Connection Time"
3. Filter by region: `asia-southeast1` (Cambodia)

**Expected Metrics:**
- Connection time: < 50ms (was 100-300ms)
- Peak connections: < 5 (was 50+)
- Connection errors: 0 (was frequent)

### Real-Time Monitoring

```bash
# Check active connections in PostgreSQL
PGPASSWORD="$DB_PASSWORD" psql -h $DB_HOST -U admin -d tarl_pratham -c \
  "SELECT count(*) as active_connections FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Expected: 2-5 (not 50+)

# Check for idle connections
PGPASSWORD="$DB_PASSWORD" psql -h $DB_HOST -U admin -d tarl_pratham -c \
  "SELECT state, count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity GROUP BY state;"

# Expected: Most in "idle" (will be cleaned up by pool_timeout=5)
```

---

## 4. Query Pattern Verification ✅

### Check that N+1 patterns are fixed

**In development, enable query logging:**
```typescript
// lib/prisma.ts - change to:
log: ['query', 'error', 'warn']
```

**Then test bulk assessment creation:**
```bash
npm run dev

# In another terminal:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/assessments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"assessments": [...]}'

# Check console output - count SELECT queries
# Expected: ~2 (not 400+)
```

### Verify No N+1 in Assessment Listing

**Before fix (old code):**
```
SELECT * FROM "Student" WHERE "id" = 1
SELECT * FROM "Student" WHERE "id" = 2
SELECT * FROM "Student" WHERE "id" = 3
... (repeated per-assessment)
```

**After fix (new code):**
```
SELECT * FROM "Student" WHERE "id" IN (1, 2, 3, ..., 100)
```

**To verify in logs:**
```bash
# Search for batch queries
grep "IN (" vercel_logs.txt  # Should find batch queries
grep "WHERE.*id.*=" vercel_logs.txt | wc -l  # Should be low count
```

---

## 5. Load Testing ✅

### Test with Apache Bench

```bash
# 100 concurrent requests, 10 requests each = 1000 total requests
ab -n 1000 -c 100 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://tarl.openplp.com/api/assessments?page=1&limit=10"

# Expected results:
# - Requests/sec: > 50 (was 10-20)
# - Failed requests: 0 (was 50+)
# - Connection pool errors: 0
```

### Test Bulk Assessment Endpoint

```bash
# Generate test payload
cat > /tmp/bulk_assessments.json << 'EOF'
{
  "assessments": [
    {
      "student_id": 1,
      "assessment_type": "baseline",
      "subject": "language",
      "level": "Level 1",
      "assessment_sample": "Sample 1",
      "student_consent": "Yes"
    },
    ... (100 items)
  ]
}
EOF

# Test with different concurrency levels
for concurrency in 10 20 50; do
  echo "Testing with $concurrency concurrent users"
  ab -n 100 -c $concurrency \
    -p /tmp/bulk_assessments.json \
    -T application/json \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    "https://tarl.openplp.com/api/assessments"
  echo ""
done

# Expected: No connection pool errors at any concurrency level
```

---

## 6. Long-Running Operations ✅

### Test Connection Pool Release (Pool Timeout)

**Vercel should release connections after 5 seconds of inactivity:**

```bash
# Make a request
curl -X GET "https://tarl.openplp.com/api/assessments"

# Wait 10 seconds
sleep 10

# Make another request
curl -X GET "https://tarl.openplp.com/api/assessments"

# Check database connections
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;

# Expected: Should be 1-2 (old connections released after 5 seconds)
```

---

## 7. Monitoring Dashboard Setup

### Vercel Analytics Dashboard

Create a custom dashboard to monitor:

1. **Function Duration**
   - Filter: `api/assessments`, `api/students`, `api/mentoring-visits`
   - Expected: P95 < 300ms

2. **Database Metrics**
   - Active Connections: < 5
   - Connection Pool Utilization: < 20%

3. **Error Rate**
   - Connection Errors: 0
   - Timeout Errors: < 0.1%

### Prisma Query Monitoring

**Enable in production (if performance permits):**
```typescript
// lib/prisma.ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: process.env.DEBUG ? ['query', 'info', 'warn', 'error'] : ['error']
});

// Then use: DEBUG=1 npm run start
```

---

## 8. Alert Setup

### Create alerts for:

1. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**
   ```
   Alert when: Active connections > 20
   Severity: Critical
   Action: Page on-call engineer
   ```

2. **Slow Queries**
   ```
   Alert when: Query duration > 1000ms
   Severity: Warning
   Action: Log to monitoring system
   ```

3. **High Error Rate**
   ```
   Alert when: 5xx errors > 1% of requests
   Severity: Critical
   Action: Rollback if necessary
   ```

---

## 9. Rollback Procedure

If something goes wrong, rollback is simple:

```bash
# See the commits
git log --oneline --all | head -20

# Find the before-optimization commit
# Revert all optimization commits
git revert <hash1> <hash2> <hash3>

# Or go back to a known-good state
git checkout <last-good-commit>

# Rebuild and deploy
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

## Support & Questions

**Performance still slow?**
1. Check cache statistics - are caches working?
2. Verify bulk assessment is using new batch queries
3. Monitor database query logs for N+1 patterns
4. Check Vercel function duration metrics

**Connection pool still high?**
1. Check pool_timeout is 5 seconds (not 30)
2. Verify old code isn't still being used
3. Check for long-running queries blocking releases
4. Monitor pg_stat_activity for idle connections

**Need to debug?**
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
DEBUG=* npm run dev

# Monitor PostgreSQL in real-time
PGPASSWORD="$DB_PASSWORD" watch -n 1 \
  "psql -h $DB_HOST -U admin -d tarl_pratham -c \
   'SELECT pid, usename, state, query_start FROM pg_stat_activity ORDER BY query_start;'"

# Check slow queries
PGPASSWORD="$DB_PASSWORD" psql -h $DB_HOST -U admin -d tarl_pratham -c \
  "SELECT query, mean_exec_time FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC LIMIT 10;"
```
