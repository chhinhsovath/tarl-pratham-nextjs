# TaRL Pratham - Fixes Summary (October 2, 2025)

## üéØ Issues Resolved

### 1. ‚úÖ Student Creation - Prisma Invocation Error
**Error:** `Unknown argument 'pilot_school_id'` when creating students

**Root Cause:** 
- Spreading `validatedData` directly caused Prisma to receive scalar IDs mixed with relation objects
- Field naming mismatch in data structure

**Fix:**
- Extracted `school_class_id` and `pilot_school_id` separately before spreading
- Explicitly pass IDs as scalar values to Prisma
- Location: `/app/api/students/route.ts:276-283`

### 2. ‚úÖ Auto-Assign School to Students
**Problem:** Teachers had to manually select school when creating students, even after profile setup

**Root Cause:**
- Student creation API wasn't reading teacher's `pilot_school_id` from session
- No auto-assignment logic for teacher's school

**Fix:**
- Auto-assign `pilot_school_id` from `session.user.pilot_school_id` if not provided
- Added validation: teachers must complete profile setup before creating students
- Returns clear Khmer error message if profile incomplete
- Location: `/app/api/students/route.ts:219-232`

### 3. ‚úÖ CRITICAL - Profile Setup Redirect Loop for Quick Login Users
**Problem:** 
- Quick login users (`chan.kimsrorn.kam`) stuck in infinite redirect loop
- Could complete profile setup but immediately redirected back to `/profile-setup`
- Could never access student pages or dashboard features

**Root Cause - THE BREAKTHROUGH:**
```
Quick login users have DIFFERENT ID namespace!
- Quick login user ID = quick_login_users.id (e.g., 78)
- Regular user ID = users.id (e.g., 69)

JWT callback was ALWAYS querying:
  prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: quickLoginUserId } })
  
This returned NULL because quick_login_users.id ‚â† users.id!
Result: Stale token, NULL pilot_school_id, infinite redirect loop.
```

**The Fix - Multi-Part Solution:**

**A. Database Schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`):
- Added `pilot_school_id`, `holding_classes`, `district` to `QuickLoginUser` model
- Ran `npx prisma db push` to update production database safely

**B. JWT Callback** (`lib/auth.ts`):
- Check `token.isQuickLogin` flag to route to correct table
- Quick login users ‚Üí query `quick_login_users` table
- Regular users ‚Üí query `users` table
- Added error handling to prevent auth crashes

**C. Profile Update API** (`app/api/profile/update/route.ts`):
- Detect login type via `session.user.isQuickLogin`
- Save profile data to appropriate table
- Quick login users now get full profile support

**D. Middleware** (`middleware.ts`):
- Allow navigation from `/profile-setup` without redirect loop
- Enhanced debugging for school assignment checks
- Added secret to `getToken()` for better JWT validation

### 4. ‚úÖ Login Success But No Redirect
**Problem:** Quick login succeeded but page didn't redirect to dashboard

**Root Cause:**
- JWT callback could crash if database query failed
- No error handling caused silent failures
- `router.push()` might not work if session not fully established

**Fix:**
- Wrapped JWT callback queries in try-catch blocks
- Changed redirect from `router.push()` to `window.location.href` (hard reload)
- Added 500ms delay to ensure session establishes
- Enhanced console logging to track login flow
- Location: `/app/auth/login/page.tsx:86-103` & `/lib/auth.ts`

### 5. ‚úÖ Profile Update API - 500 Internal Server Error  
**Problem:** Profile setup form submitted but got generic 500 error

**Root Cause:**
- Production server's Prisma client was OUTDATED after schema changes
- Server didn't know about new `pilot_school_id`, `holding_classes`, `district` columns
- Error: `Unknown argument 'pilot_school_id'` in Prisma client

**Fix:**
- Modified `package.json` scripts:
  ```json
  "build": "prisma generate && next build"
  "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  ```
- This ensures Prisma client ALWAYS regenerates on:
  - Production builds
  - Dependency installations
  - CI/CD deployments

### 6. ‚úÖ Mock Data in Teacher Dashboard
**Problem:** Teacher dashboard showed hardcoded Khmer student names and fake data

**Root Cause:**
- `TeacherRepository.ts` was using static mock arrays
- All queries returned hardcoded data instead of database queries

**Fix - Complete Repository Rewrite:**
- **findStudentsByTeacher()**: Now queries real students via Prisma
  - Fetches actual assessments per student
  - Calculates real improvement rates (baseline ‚Üí latest)
  - Determines status from actual performance

- **getClassPerformance()**: Real data aggregation
  - Class average from actual scores
  - Subject breakdown (Khmer/Math) from real assessments
  - Performance distribution based on actual ranges

- **getPendingTasks()**: Dynamic task generation
  - Finds students missing baseline assessments
  - Fetches upcoming mentoring visits from database

- **getDashboardStats()**: Real statistics
  - Actual student count for teacher
  - Real assessment counts
  - Calculated class average from recent data

## üìä Impact Summary

### Before Fixes:
- ‚ùå Quick login users couldn't use the system (redirect loop)
- ‚ùå Students created without school assignment
- ‚ùå Teachers saw fake/mock data
- ‚ùå Profile setup failed with cryptic errors
- ‚ùå Prisma errors after schema changes

### After Fixes:
- ‚úÖ Quick login users work perfectly
- ‚úÖ Students auto-linked to teacher's school
- ‚úÖ Real data throughout dashboard
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages in Khmer
- ‚úÖ Auto Prisma client regeneration

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

See **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** for complete deployment procedures.

**Quick Deploy:**
```bash
git pull origin main
npm install      # Auto-runs prisma generate
npm run build    # Also runs prisma generate
pm2 restart all
```

## üîß Key Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `prisma/schema.prisma` | Added fields to QuickLoginUser model |
| `lib/auth.ts` | Fixed JWT callback to query correct table |
| `app/api/profile/update/route.ts` | Support for quick login user profiles |
| `app/api/students/route.ts` | Auto-assign school, fix Prisma invocation |
| `lib/services/TeacherRepository.ts` | Replaced ALL mock data with real queries |
| `middleware.ts` | Enhanced redirect logic, better debugging |
| `app/auth/login/page.tsx` | Improved redirect with error handling |
| `package.json` | Auto Prisma generation on build/install |

## üìà Technical Achievements

1. **Proper Multi-Table Auth**: Correctly handles users across 2 tables based on login type
2. **Zero Data Loss**: Used `prisma db push` instead of migrations for safe schema updates
3. **Auto-Deployment**: Build scripts ensure Prisma client always up-to-date
4. **Real Data Integration**: Complete replacement of mock data with Prisma queries
5. **Error Resilience**: Try-catch blocks prevent auth crashes

## üéì Lessons Learned

### The ID Namespace Discovery
The biggest breakthrough was understanding that quick login users have a different ID namespace. This wasn't documented anywhere and caused 3+ hours of debugging. The key insight:

```typescript
// Quick Login User
token.id = quickUser.id  // This is quick_login_users.id

// Regular User  
token.id = user.id       // This is users.id

// JWT Callback was doing:
prisma.user.findUnique({ id: token.id })
// For quick login users, this ALWAYS returns NULL!
// Because quick_login_users.id ‚â† users.id
```

### The Prisma Client Cache Problem
Production servers don't automatically regenerate Prisma client after schema changes. This caused "Unknown argument" errors that were hard to debug. The solution: automate regeneration in build scripts.

### The Spread Operator Pitfall
Spreading validated data with IDs can confuse Prisma about whether it's receiving scalar values or relation objects. Always extract and pass IDs explicitly.
