> since most of the features are already made, i see most of the platform having guide tips to explain what are these menu, links , buttons are working for like step by
 step across the screen for the first time, can you tell me that features what do we called?

⏺ The feature you're describing is called an "Onboarding Tour" or "Product Tour". Here are the common names and implementations:

  🎯 Feature Names:

  - Product Tour / App Tour
  - Interactive Walkthrough
  - Guided Tour
  - Feature Introduction
  - Onboarding Flow
  - Step-by-Step Guide
  - Tooltips Tour
  - User Onboarding

  🛠️ Popular Implementation Libraries:

  React/Next.js Libraries:

  1. React Joyride ⭐ (Most popular)
  npm install react-joyride
  2. Reactour
  npm install @reactour/tour
  3. Intro.js for React
  npm install intro.js react-intro.js
  4. Shepherd.js
  npm install shepherd.js

  📱 For Your TaRL Pratham Project:

  Since you have a multilingual (Khmer/English) education platform with role-based access, I'd recommend React Joyride because it:

  - ✅ Works perfectly with Next.js 15
  - ✅ Supports multilingual content
  - ✅ Mobile-responsive (important for your mobile-optimized app)
  - ✅ Role-based tours (different tours for Admin, Teacher, Mentor, etc.)
  - ✅ Customizable styling to match your design
  - ✅ Ant Design compatible

  🎨 Typical Implementation:

  // Example tour steps for TaRL Pratham
  const tourSteps = [
    {
      target: '.dashboard-menu',
      content: 'នេះជាផ្ទាំងគ្រប់គ្រងសម្រាប់មើលទិន្នន័យសរុប', // Khmer text
      placement: 'bottom'
    },
    {
      target: '.assessment-button',
      content: 'ចុចទីនេះដើម្បីបង្កើតការវាយតម្លៃថ្មី',
      placement: 'right'
    }
  ];

  🚀 Benefits for Educational Platform:

  - First-time user guidance for teachers/mentors
  - Feature discovery for complex dashboards
  - Reduce support requests
  - Improve user adoption
  - Role-specific guidance (Teacher tour vs Admin tour)
