# Mentor Multi-School Access System

## üìã Overview

This document describes the comprehensive mentor multi-school access system that allows coordinators to assign mentors to multiple schools for specific subjects (Language and/or Math).

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Multi-School Assignment**
- Coordinators can assign one mentor to multiple schools
- Each assignment is subject-specific (Language or Math)
- One mentor can be assigned to different schools for different subjects
- Example: Mentor A ‚Üí School 1 (Language), School 2 (Math), School 3 (Language + Math)

### 2. **Backwards Compatibility**
- System maintains compatibility with old single-school setup
- If a mentor has no assignments in `mentor_school_assignments` table, the system falls back to `user.pilot_school_id`
- Legacy mentors continue working without disruption

### 3. **Comprehensive Dashboard**
- Mentors see all their assigned schools in one dashboard
- Statistics aggregated across all schools
- School selector for filtering data
- Subject-specific indicators

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Table: `mentor_school_assignments`

```sql
CREATE TABLE mentor_school_assignments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  mentor_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  pilot_school_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES pilot_schools(id),
  subject VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- "Language" or "Math"
  assigned_by_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  assigned_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(mentor_id, pilot_school_id, subject)
);
```

**Indexes:**
- `idx_mentor_school_assignments_mentor_id`
- `idx_mentor_school_assignments_pilot_school_id`
- `idx_mentor_school_assignments_subject`
- `idx_mentor_school_assignments_is_active`

## üîê Authorization Flow

### How Multi-School Access Works

```typescript
// Old (Single School)
if (session.user.role === "mentor") {
  where.pilot_school_id = session.user.pilot_school_id;
}

// New (Multi-School)
if (session.user.role === "mentor") {
  const schoolIds = await getMentorSchoolIds(mentorId);
  where.pilot_school_id = { in: schoolIds };
}
```

### Backwards Compatibility Logic

```typescript
async function getMentorSchoolIds(mentorId: number) {
  // 1. Try to get from assignments table
  const assignments = await prisma.mentorSchoolAssignment.findMany({
    where: { mentor_id: mentorId, is_active: true }
  });

  if (assignments.length > 0) {
    return assignments.map(a => a.pilot_school_id);
  }

  // 2. Fallback to user.pilot_school_id (backwards compat)
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: mentorId }});
  if (user?.pilot_school_id) {
    return [user.pilot_school_id];
  }

  // 3. No access
  return [];
}
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### For Coordinators

#### 1. Assign Mentor to School

```bash
POST /api/mentor-assignments
{
  "mentor_id": 123,
  "pilot_school_id": 45,
  "subject": "Language",
  "notes": "Primary language mentor for this school"
}
```

#### 2. List All Assignments

```bash
GET /api/mentor-assignments?mentor_id=123
```

#### 3. Update Assignment Status

```bash
PUT /api/mentor-assignments
{
  "id": 1,
  "is_active": false,
  "notes": "Temporarily inactive due to leave"
}
```

### For Mentors

#### 1. View Dashboard

Navigate to `/mentor/dashboard` to see:
- All assigned schools
- Student counts per school
- Assessment statistics
- Recent activities
- School selector for filtering

#### 2. Using School Selector Component

```tsx
import SchoolSelector from "@/components/mentor/SchoolSelector";

function MyComponent() {
  const [selectedSchool, setSelectedSchool] = useState<number | "all">("all");

  return (
    <SchoolSelector
      value={selectedSchool}
      onChange={setSelectedSchool}
      allowAll={true}
      showSubjectTag={true}
    />
  );
}
```

## üîß API Integration Examples

### Students API (Multi-School)

```typescript
// Before
const students = await prisma.student.findMany({
  where: {
    pilot_school_id: session.user.pilot_school_id // Single school
  }
});

// After
const mentorSchoolIds = await getMentorSchoolIds(mentorId);
const students = await prisma.student.findMany({
  where: {
    pilot_school_id: { in: mentorSchoolIds } // Multiple schools
  }
});
```

### Assessments API (Multi-School + Subject Filtering)

```typescript
const mentorSchoolIds = await getMentorSchoolIds(mentorId);

// Optional: Add subject filtering
const assignedSubjects = await getMentorAssignedSubjects(mentorId);

const assessments = await prisma.assessment.findMany({
  where: {
    pilot_school_id: { in: mentorSchoolIds },
    // Uncomment for strict subject filtering:
    // subject: { in: assignedSubjects.map(s => s.toLowerCase()) }
  }
});
```

## üîÑ Migration Path

### For Existing Mentors

1. **No Action Required**: Existing mentors continue working with `user.pilot_school_id`
2. **Coordinator Creates Assignments**: When coordinator assigns them to schools, new system takes over
3. **Automatic Transition**: System automatically uses assignments when available, falls back to user profile otherwise

### For New Mentors

1. **Profile Setup**: Create user with role="mentor"
2. **Assignment Creation**: Coordinator assigns to schools via `/coordinator/mentor-assignments`
3. **Access Granted**: Mentor immediately has access to all assigned schools

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Mentor Can't See Any Data

**Check:**
1. Does mentor have assignments in `mentor_school_assignments`?
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM mentor_school_assignments WHERE mentor_id = X;
   ```
2. If no assignments, does mentor have `pilot_school_id` in users table?
   ```sql
   SELECT pilot_school_id FROM users WHERE id = X;
   ```
3. Are assignments active?
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM mentor_school_assignments WHERE mentor_id = X AND is_active = true;
   ```

### Duplicate Assignment Error

**Issue**: "Assignment already exists for this mentor, school, and subject"

**Solution**: Check for existing assignment:
```sql
SELECT * FROM mentor_school_assignments
WHERE mentor_id = X
  AND pilot_school_id = Y
  AND subject = 'Language';
```

Either update the existing one or delete it first.

## üìù Design Decisions

### Why Not Strict Subject Filtering?

Currently, assessments API shows ALL assessments at assigned schools, regardless of subject assignment. This was intentional because:

1. **Flexibility**: Mentors often help across subjects
2. **Visibility**: Better to see all school data for comprehensive oversight
3. **Optional Filtering**: Code includes commented-out strict filtering if needed

To enable strict subject filtering, uncomment in `app/api/assessments/route.ts:145-151`:

```typescript
const assignedSubjects = await getMentorAssignedSubjects(parseInt(session.user.id));
if (assignedSubjects.length > 0 && !subject) {
  where.subject = { in: assignedSubjects.map(s => s.toLowerCase()) };
}
```

### Why Backwards Compatibility?

Keeps existing mentors working without database migration. Gradual transition allows:
- Testing new system with select mentors
- No downtime or data migration
- Smooth rollout

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **Auto-Expiring Assignments**: Add `valid_until` date
2. **Assignment Templates**: Preset configurations for common patterns
3. **Bulk Assignment**: Assign multiple mentors at once
4. **Assignment History**: Track who was assigned when
5. **Notification System**: Alert mentors when assigned to new schools
6. **Mobile Dashboard**: Optimize mentor dashboard for mobile devices
7. **Offline Support**: Cache assignments for offline access
