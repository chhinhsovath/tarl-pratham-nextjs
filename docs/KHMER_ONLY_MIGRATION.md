## 🔧 Critical API Fix (Completed)

### Assessment API - PilotSchool Field Names
**File**: `/app/api/assessments/route.ts`

**Problem**: 500 error when creating assessments
```
Unknown field 'name' for select statement on model PilotSchool
```

**Root Cause**: Prisma schema uses `school_name` and `school_code`, not `name` and `code`

**Fix Applied** (Lines 154-159, 339-344, 586-591):
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (Incorrect)
pilot_school: {
  select: {
    id: true,
    name: true,      // ← Field doesn't exist!
    code: true       // ← Field doesn't exist!
  }
}

// ✅ AFTER (Correct)
pilot_school: {
  select: {
    id: true,
    school_name: true,  // ← Matches Prisma schema
    school_code: true   // ← Matches Prisma schema
  }
}
```

2. **Dropdowns**: Never show English translations in parentheses
3. **API Responses**: Field names remain in English (database compatibility), but display text should be Khmer
4. **PilotSchool Model**: Remember to use `school_name` and `school_code`, not `name` and `code`
5. **Testing**: Always verify with Khmer-speaking users who have zero English knowledge
