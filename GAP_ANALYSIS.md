## ⚠️ Potential Gaps (Need Verification)

### 1. Assessment Workflow Completion

#### ❓ Assessment Edit/Update
**Status:** Need to verify
**Question:** Can users edit/update existing assessments after creation?
**Files to check:**
- `/app/assessments/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Does this exist?
- `/api/assessments/[id]` - Does PUT method work?

**Test:**
1. Create assessment for student
2. Try to edit the level or score
3. Check if it saves

#### ❓ Assessment Deletion
**Status:** Implemented in code but needs testing
**Location:** `/app/assessments/page.tsx` line 167
**Test:**
1. Try to delete an assessment
2. Check if it's removed from database
3. Verify permissions (mentor can only delete temporary, teacher can delete production)

---

### 2. Student Assessment History

#### ❓ Student Detail Page - Assessment History
**Status:** Need to verify display
**File:** `/app/students/[id]/page.tsx`
**Question:** When viewing student #15, does it show:
- Baseline assessment (if exists)
- Midline assessment (if exists)
- Endline assessment (if exists)
- Progress chart/graph?

**Expected:** Should see student's full assessment timeline

---

### 3. Bulk Assessment - Data Entry Page

#### ❓ `/assessments/data-entry` Page
**Status:** Exists but need to verify functionality
**File:** `/app/assessments/data-entry/page.tsx`
**Question:** Is this page working? Or is it replaced by `/assessments/create-bulk`?

**From your earlier request:** You wanted bulk assessment grid
**What we built:** `/assessments/create-bulk` with radio button grid

**Need to clarify:**
- Is `/assessments/data-entry` still needed?
- Or should we remove it and only use `/assessments/create-bulk`?

---

### 4. Assessment Verification

#### ❓ Assessment Verification Workflow
**Status:** Page exists with TODOs
**File:** `/app/verification/page.tsx`
**TODOs found:**
- "TODO: Create verification API endpoint"
- "TODO: Fetch real statistics from API"

**What's missing:**
- Mentors verify teacher assessments
- Bulk verification (approve multiple assessments)
- Verification status tracking
- Notifications when verification needed

**Current implementation:** Demo data only

---

### 5. Reports & Analytics

#### ❓ Real Data in Reports
**Status:** Multiple TODOs found
**Files with TODOs:**

**Mentor Dashboard:**
- `/app/api/dashboard/mentor-stats/route.ts`
- TODO: Calculate actual school comparison data from assessments

**Teacher Dashboard:**
- `/app/teacher/dashboard/page.tsx`
- TODO: Calculate class_average from actual assessment scores
- TODO: Calculate improvement_rate from baseline vs current
- TODO: Implement pending tasks from mentoring visits API
- TODO: Implement progress tracking from assessments API

**Admin Dashboard:**
- `/app/api/dashboard/admin-stats/route.ts`
- TODO: Implement actual attendance tracking
- TODO: Calculate academic_performance from actual assessment scores

**Intervention Reports:**
- `/app/reports/intervention/page.tsx`
- TODO: Create interventions API endpoint

**What's working:** Basic structure and UI
**What's missing:** Real data calculations from database

**File:** `/app/assessments/periods/page.tsx`

**Questions:**
- Can admin define assessment periods (dates)?

- Student assessment overdue → Teacher notified
- Onboarding step completed → User sees checkmark

**Current:** Likely missing or incomplete

---

### 12. Mobile Responsiveness

#### ❓ Mobile View for Teachers

- CSS file exists: `styles/mobile.css`

**Need to test:**

---

### 13. Offline Capability

#### ❓ Offline Mode
**Status:** Page exists `/app/offline/page.tsx`

**Questions:**

### 15. Assessment Level Fields in Students Table

#### ❓ Student Level Fields Update
**Status:** Need to verify

**Expected:** When assessment created, student record updates:

- `baseline_math_level`
- `midline_khmer_level`
- `midline_math_level`
- `endline_khmer_level`
- `endline_math_level`

**Code exists:** `/app/api/assessments/route.ts` line 357
```typescript
await prisma.student.update({
  where: { id: student_id },
  data: { [levelField]: level }
});
```

**Need to verify:** Does this actually run? Check student #15 after assessment.
